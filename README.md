## Dataset Overview

The dataset contains customer information such as:

- `MonthlyCharges`: Monthly billing amount
- `Churned`: Whether the customer churned (Yes or No)
- `TenureMonths`: Number of months the customer has stayed

---

## Summary Statistics

### Central Tendency:
- **Mean**: 72.91  
- **Median**: 71.18  
- **Mode**: 65.32  

### Dispersion:
- **Standard Deviation**: 31.83  
- **Variance**: 1012.99  
- **Range**: 323.82  
- **IQR**: 25.96

## Skewness & Kurtosis

- Skewness indicates if the distribution is symmetric.
- Kurtosis tells us how peaked the distribution is.

**Skewness**:
- CustomerID: `0.000000`
- MonthlyCharges: `4.140285`
- TenureMonths: `0.065376`

**Kurtosis**:
- CustomerID: `-1.200000`
- MonthlyCharges: `28.574482`
- TenureMonths: `-1.303213`

## More On Outliers

# Outlier Detection and Cleaning with Python  

This project demonstrates how **outliers** can distort descriptive statistics and how to handle them using the **Interquartile Range (IQR) method**.  

---

## Project Overview  
We simulate a healthcare dataset with patient information (**BMI**, **cholesterol**, **blood pressure**). Then, we:  
1. Generate normally distributed data for 300 patients.  
2. Inject extreme **BMI** (80‚Äì150) and **cholesterol** (500‚Äì1000) outliers.  
3. Detect outliers using the **IQR rule**.  
4. Compare **means vs medians** before and after cleaning.  
5. Visualize distributions with **boxplots**.

## Key Concepts  

### 1. Detecting Outliers with IQR  
The **Interquartile Range (IQR)** is defined as:  

\[
IQR = Q3 - Q1
\]  

- **Lower bound** = Q1 ‚Äì 1.5 √ó IQR  
- **Upper bound** = Q3 + 1.5 √ó IQR  
- Any value outside these bounds is flagged as an **outlier**.  

### 2. Why Outliers Matter  
- **Means** are highly sensitive to extreme values.  
- **Medians** are more robust and resistant to distortion.

## Results  

### Before vs After Cleaning  

| Metric                  | With Outliers üö® | Without Outliers ‚úÖ |
|--------------------------|------------------|---------------------|
| **BMI Mean**            | Inflated         | More realistic      |
| **BMI Median**          | Stable           | Stable              |
| **Cholesterol Mean**    | Inflated         | More reliable       |
| **Cholesterol Median**  | Stable           | Stable              |

---

## Visualizations  

Boxplots make it easy to spot outliers:  

- **BMI** outliers appear as extreme points above the whiskers.  
- **Cholesterol** outliers (500‚Äì1000) clearly distort the spread.

## Takeaways

Outliers aren‚Äôt always ‚Äúbad‚Äù ‚Äî sometimes they‚Äôre the most interesting cases.
For general trends, removing/flagging them ensures reliable insights.
Always compare mean vs median when analyzing skewed data.

## Next Steps

Try winsorization (capping extreme values instead of removing them).
Use robust statistics for skewed data.
Analyze outliers separately to see if they represent rare but important events.
